When new visitors browse through your website they are confronted with many questions:

* Is this product the right one for me?
* Is it secure to give my payment details to this store?
* Will they ship the product or run with the money?

To answer these questions, potential shoppers are willing to put trust in their peers (social proof). Therefore, when a potential buyer sees how many other people have bought from your store, when was the transaction and which product they bought, they are provided with social proof cues that help them trust your store.

Companies like eBay, Groupon or Agoda know really well the power of social proof to drive sales, that’s why they use it all over their websites.

<strong>Would you like to use social proof to your advantage just like big brands do? SIP Social Proof for WooCommerce is here to help.</strong>
